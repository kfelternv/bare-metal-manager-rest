// However, There are 2 problems with session advisory locks. and
// hence session advisory locks are not recommended. and transaction
// advisory locks are recommended. hence this method is not exposed.
//
// Problem 1.
// Since the application only works with a connection
// pool implemented in database/sql, the specific connection on which the
// session advisory lock is acquired is not visible to the application.
// Hence the application is unable to correctly unlock the lock,
// since it does not have the connection handle (which was used to lock)
//
// Problem 2.
// session advisory locks can be taken multiple times on the same
// connection. It is possible therefore that 2 api's could both acquire the
// session lock (since they both use the same connection pool, and it could
// so happen that they used the same connection to execute their sqls).
